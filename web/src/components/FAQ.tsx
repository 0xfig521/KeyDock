    question: "How is this different from .env files?",
    answer:
      "A .env file is tied to one directory and is easy to scatter across projects, backups, and cloud storage. KeyDock keeps secrets in one local encrypted vault, then maps selected fields into reusable presets. You can activate a preset for new shells or inject it into one command without editing project files.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it secure?",
    answer:
      "Your vault is encrypted with Argon2id key derivation and ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption. The decryption key lives in application memory only while the vault is unlocked. KeyDock makes no network requests — your secrets never leave your machine.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work on macOS / Linux / Windows?",
    answer:
      "Yes. KeyDock is built with Tauri, so the desktop app runs on all three platforms. The CLI is a single Rust binary that works anywhere Rust targets are supported.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use it without the desktop app?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The CLI can inspect presets, activate and deactivate shell environments, print shell hooks, open the app, and run one-shot commands with preset variables injected. The desktop app adds visual secret editing, preset composition, audit browsing, and quick-copy workflows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer cloud sync or team sharing?",
    answer:
      "Not yet. KeyDock is designed as a local-first tool. Cloud sync and team sharing are under consideration but would need to be optional and end-to-end encrypted. If these matter to you, star the repo and follow along.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I migrate my existing .env files?",
    answer:
      "For now, migration is manual: create secrets from templates, add your existing values, then map the fields into presets with the env names your tools expect. An importer for .env files is planned.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use KeyDock in CI/CD pipelines?",
    answer:
      "Not yet. KeyDock is focused on local development workstations. For automation on your machine, use `keydock run <preset> -- <command>` to inject a scoped set of variables into one process.",
