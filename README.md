## English

> KeyDock is a **local-first vault for developer API keys**, with activatable env presets. Store secrets locally, compose them into reusable presets, and activate one global env set for all new terminals.

KeyDock is not trying to replace enterprise SecretOps platforms. It focuses on the developer workstation layer: solo developers, small teams, and AI-assisted coding workflows where `.env` sprawl and global shell exports are too easy to leak.

### Why KeyDock?

Modern developer workflows are full of secrets: AI provider keys, proxy URLs, account IDs, cloud tokens, search APIs, and per-client credentials. Copying them between `.env` files is fragile; exporting them globally is risky.

KeyDock gives you a safer loop:

1. Store secrets in a local encrypted vault.
2. Create presets from templates (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cloudflare, Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, etc.).
3. Compose presets together — `fullstack-dev` includes `ai-dev` and `cloud-deploy`.
4. Activate one preset, and every new terminal inherits the same trusted env vars.

The next product direction is **agent-safe secret injection**: give Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, scripts, and dev servers only the scoped variables they need for one command, with redaction and local auditability as the trust layer.

### Highlights

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Local encrypted vault** | Keeps secrets on your machine with Argon2id + ChaCha20Poly1305. |
| **Preset templates** | Built-in templates for OpenAI, Anthropic, Cloudflare, Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, and more. |
| **Preset composition** | Combine presets — `fullstack-dev` includes `ai-dev` + `cloud-deploy`. |
| **Preset activation** | Activate one preset for all new terminals. No more `.env` sprawl. |
| **One-shot command injection** | Run a command with a preset's env vars without changing global shell state. |
| **Desktop control center** | Tauri + React UI for dashboard, secrets, presets, audit, and settings. |
| **Audit visibility** | Tracks sensitive actions such as reveal, copy, export, and mutations. |
| **Shell integration** | Generates hooks for `zsh` and `bash`. |
| **Bilingual UI foundation** | Includes English and Chinese locale files powered by i18next. |
| **AI-agent-safe direction** | Roadmap focus: scoped injection, output redaction, and command-level audit trails. |

### How it feels

```bash
# Activate a preset for future shells
keydock preset activate fullstack-dev

# Check what is currently active
keydock preset current

# Preview what env vars a preset will export
keydock preset preview fullstack-dev

# Run a command with a preset injected just for this process
keydock run fullstack-dev -- bun run dev

# Clean up active preset cache
keydock preset deactivate
```

```

### Quick start

#### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Platform requirements for [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/)

#### Install and run

```bash
bun install
bun run tauri dev
```

#### Build frontend assets

```bash
bun run build
```

#### Run Rust tests

```bash
cargo test
```

#### Inspect the CLI

```bash
cargo run -p keydock-cli -- --help
```

### CLI reference

```bash
keydock preset templates            # List available preset templates
keydock preset list                 # List all presets
keydock preset show <preset>        # Show preset details
keydock preset preview <preset>     # Preview env vars without activating
keydock preset activate <preset>    # Activate preset for new shells
keydock preset current              # Show the active preset
keydock preset deactivate           # Remove the active preset cache
keydock hook <zsh|bash>             # Print shell hook code
keydock open                        # Open the KeyDock desktop app on macOS
keydock run <preset> -- <cmd>       # Run a command with preset env vars
```

### Security model

KeyDock is designed as a **local-first** vault:

- A master password derives a key with **Argon2id**.
- A local data-encryption key is decrypted after unlock.
- The decrypted key stays in app memory while the vault is unlocked.
- Preset activation writes a plaintext env cache so new shells can load mapped variables.
- One-shot command injection avoids polluting the global shell and is the preferred path for AI-agent or automation workflows.
- Touch ID / passkey unlock is planned as a convenience path, not the root trust anchor.

> Treat activated preset env caches like any other plaintext shell secret: convenient, local, and intentionally short-lived in your workflow.

For AI coding agents, prefer `keydock run <preset> -- <cmd>` over globally exporting secrets. The intended trust boundary is command-scoped access, not “the agent can read the whole shell environment”.

### Current scope

Implemented / in progress:

- Local encrypted secret storage
- Preset templates (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cloudflare, Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, etc.)
- Preset composition (include other presets)
- Preset activation and deactivation
- CLI preset management and one-shot command injection
- Tauri desktop UI
- Quick copy formats
- Audit log UI
- English / Chinese app localization resources

Deferred:

- Agent-safe scoped secret injection presets
- Output redaction for command logs
- Local secret health checks
- Repo / agent config scanner for leaked secrets
- Local HTTP API
- Cloud sync
- Team sharing
- RBAC
- Plugin system
- Automatic preset switching

### Roadmap focus

#### v0.6: Launch-ready developer workflow

- Keep all version metadata and release/update URLs aligned with the `0xfig-labs/KeyDock` repository.
- Improve first-run onboarding: create vault, add a first secret from template, create preset, activate it.
- Add screenshot / GIF slots to the website for vault UI, preset composition, and CLI injection.
- Document unsigned/ad-hoc macOS distribution clearly while preparing Developer ID signing and notarization.

#### v0.7: AI-agent-safe mode

- Command-scoped allowlists for env vars.
- Agent profiles for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and generic shell.
- Local audit events for which command accessed which preset variables.
- Redaction helpers for logs and copied command output.

#### Later

- Local secret health checks and rotation reminders.
- Encrypted import/export for lightweight sharing.
- Optional team/cloud sync only after the local-first workflow is proven.

### Development workflow

```bash
# install dependencies
bun install

# launch desktop app
bun run tauri dev

# run frontend build
bun run build

# run Rust tests
cargo test
```
